## Introduction
This Udacity nanodegree course in python for data science introduces some key modules needed for data analytics like NumPy and pandas to make good sense from the bikeshare data.

## How to use
The repository contains-
1. Three csv files containing the data for three cities- chicago.csv, new_york_city.csv, and washington.csv.
2. One python file written to assess the data in the csv files- bikeshare_project1.py.

To Execute this project-
1. Place the bikeshare_project1.py file and all the CSV files in the same folder.
2. Run the python file using a suitable python interpreter.

## Resources
To complete the project, I used my knowledge which I gained over the course of studying the Python Foundation Nanodegree Program on Udacity.
If I got stuck some place, the source(s) below helped me-
1. [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
2. [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/)
3. [Tutorials Point](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/)
4. [Pandas Documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.17.0/)
5. I used [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) extensively for quickly running small snippets of code, and [Visual studio editor](https://atom.io/) for bigger pieces of code.
6. Text book like Python Data analytics by [Fabio Neil also helped me]
